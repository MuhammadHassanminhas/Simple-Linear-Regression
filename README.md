## In This Repo I have Written A Python Script In Which I have Founded The Value Of m and c In Simple Linear Regression For The Data Set I Have Used. 
If you want to know more about SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION read my blog: https://medium.com/@muhammadhassan1762005/a-beginners-guide-to-simple-linear-regression-and-its-mathematical-formulation-from-scratch-8d86b9fdf572

These are the data points ploted on a graph:

Now The graph with the regression line:

I have also find the ERROR value of our regression model using MAE ( Mean Absolute Error). 

If you want to know more about MAE read my blog on this: https://medium.com/@muhammadhassan1762005/mae-mean-absolute-error-in-machine-learning-e678cc7bb8d4
